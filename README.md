# Learning Journey
## Story 1 - Getting Started
![Walk](/assets/walk.jpg)

As an engineer, my focus had always been on traditional systems and processes. Tech and data, though ever-present in the headlines, were worlds I had yet to explore. That changed in late 2023 when a close friend of mine introduced me to the concept of cloud computing. Intrigued by its possibilities, I decided to challenge myself and signed up for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.

The learning curve was steep at first, with new terminologies and concepts. But with two months of focused study, I was able to grasp the fundamentals of cloud infrastructure, services, and solutions. Earning my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification felt like a major milestone, not just in terms of technical achievement, but also as a first step into a field I was eager to explore further. This experience opened my eyes to the immense potential of technology, and I knew this was just the beginning of my learning journey.

## Story 2 - Crossroads
![Road](/assets/crossroad.jpg)

My initial journey into cloud computing ignited a deeper passion for data and technology. I found myself dedicating more of my personal time (after work and even on weekends) exploring these fields. From watching YouTube tutorials to enrolling in Udemy courses, I was constantly seeking more knowledge.

However, balancing full-time work with my studies soon became overwhelming, and I found myself at a crossroads. I had to make a critical decision: should I continue this difficult balancing act, or take the leap into full-time study? After much internal debate, planning, and research, I decided to take a bold step forward. I left my job and fully committed myself to pursuing my passion for data and cloud technologies. It was a leap of faith, but one that felt right for my personal and professional growth.

## Story 3 - Studies & Forging Bonds

After taking the leap into full-time studies, I quickly realized that the journey would be intense. The pace was relentless, and I often found myself sacrificing weekends and free time to keep up with coursework and project deadlines. But this time, something was different, I didn’t feel drained or exhausted. In fact, I felt more energized and motivated than ever before. It dawned on me that this was the difference between doing something out of necessity and doing something because you’re truly passionate about it.

Despite the challenges, I was surrounded by people who shared that same passion. In my cohort, I met individuals who were just as eager to learn, push boundaries, and support one another. We weren’t just classmates; we became a close-knit community. Together, we tackled complex problems, shared knowledge & resources, and learned from each other’s strengths. We even attended workshops and events as a group, further deepening our understanding of the data and tech world.

What made this experience so special wasn’t just the knowledge gained, but the friendships formed. It was incredibly encouraging to be part of a group that celebrated each other’s successes and helped lift one another during difficult times. These friendships made the hard work not just bearable, but enjoyable. It felt like we were all on this transformative journey together, striving toward a shared goal.

After months of intense study, the end of our program came faster than I had imagined. While our time together in the classroom may be over, I’m certain this is only the beginning for all of us. These friendships and connections we’ve built are just as valuable as the knowledge we’ve gained. I’m grateful for the support and camaraderie we shared and have no doubt our paths will cross again in the future. Here’s to the exciting journeys that lie ahead for all of us. Cheers!

## Story 4 - Learning Never Stops

One of the most important lessons I’ve learned on this journey is that education doesn’t end when you earn a certificate or finish a course. It’s a continuous process, especially in the tech and data fields where innovation is constant. Since completing my formal studies, I’ve made it a point to keep learning.

I regularly attend workshops, engage in webinars, and stay updated with the latest tools and techniques. Beyond just absorbing new knowledge, I actively apply what I learn through hands-on projects, ensuring that theory translates into practical skills. Whether it’s experimenting with new cloud computing tools or diving into AI advancements, I’ve come to realize that growth comes from consistent practice and an eagerness to embrace the unknown.

Every workshop, event, or resource is an opportunity to refine my skills, challenge my understanding, and adapt to the evolving landscape. My commitment to learning is not just about keeping up; it’s about staying ahead and pushing myself further in this ever-changing industry.
