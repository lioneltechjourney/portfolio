# About Me

I'm an aspiring professional transitioning into the tech/data industry while bringing over 6+ years of experience, problem-solving abilities, and project management skills from previous engineering (medical and semiconductor) background. 

The first step may be tough, but it’s the beginning of great things. Let’s go!

## Projects

### Capstone Project: Machine Failure Prediction & Anomaly Detection
Developed & deployed a predictive model for machine failure forecasting using Streamlit for cloud-based access. Created an unsupervised model for anomaly detection and built an interactive dashboard for real-time anomaly monitoring, optimizing maintenance schedules and enhancing operational efficiency. 
- Methods used: EDA, Machine Learning, AutoEncoders, PowerBI, Streamlit
- App Link: https://machine-prediction.streamlit.app/ 


Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
