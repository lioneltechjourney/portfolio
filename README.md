# About Me

I'm an aspiring professional transitioning into the tech/data industry while bringing over 6+ years of experience, problem-solving abilities, and project management skills from previous engineering (medical and semiconductor) background. 

The first step may be tough, but it’s the beginning of great things. Let’s go!

## Projects

### Capstone Project: Machine Failure Prediction & Anomaly Detection
Developed & deployed a predictive model for machine failure forecasting using Streamlit for cloud-based access. Created an unsupervised model for anomaly detection and built an interactive dashboard for real-time anomaly monitoring, optimizing maintenance schedules and enhancing operational efficiency. 
- Methods used: EDA, Machine Learning, AutoEncoders, PowerBI, Streamlit
- App Link: https://machine-prediction.streamlit.app/ 

### Project 1: Anti-Money Laundering Transaction Monitoring & Streamlit App Deployment
Designed and deployed a predictive model to identify high-risk financial transactions, enhancing compliance with AML regulations and enabling real-time risk assessments for detecting suspicious activities. 
- Methods used: EDA, Machine Learning, Streamlit, Network Analysis
- App Link: https://risk-predictor.streamlit.app/ 

### Project 2: Amazon Fake Review Detection & Sentiment Analysis
Performed text preprocessing, clustering and sentiment analysis to identify fake reviews. Utilized data insights to enhance review authenticity, improve customer trust and detect fraudulent patterns in product feedback.
- Methods used: EDA, Machine Learning, DBSCAN, NLP, Sentiment Analysis via VADER

### Project 3: Inventory Optimization via Predictive Modelling
Performed exploratory data analysis and identified patterns to deliver insights and strategic recommendations using supervised machine learning for optimizing inventory management, preventing stockouts and overstock. 
- Methods used: EDA, Machine Learning

### Project 4: Singapore Car Purchase Timing Analysis
Cleaned, analysed data to identify trends and performed hypothesis testing to provide actionable insights on optimal car purchase timing in Singapore, recommending periods with the lowest COE premiums. 
- Methods used: EDA, Trending analysis, Hypothesis testing
